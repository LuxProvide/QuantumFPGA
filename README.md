# Introduction to Quantum Exact Simulation with Intel® FPGA

## Introduction

Quantum computing exact simulations involve the use of classical computers to model and analyze the behavior of quantum systems and quantum algorithms, bridging the gap between theoretical quantum mechanics and practical quantum computing technologies. These simulations are crucial for developing, testing, and optimizing quantum algorithms before they are run on actual quantum hardware, which is often limited in availability and capability.


## Content

In this course, you will learn to:

- How to use Meluxina's FPGA, i.e., Intel® FPGA

- How to exploit FPGA for quantum simulation

- How to take advantage of the Intel® oneAPI to code quantum circuit



## Who is the course for

This course is for students, researchers, enginners wishing to discover how to use oneAPI to program FPGA in this fantastic fields which is Quantum Computing. Participants should still have some experience with Python & modern C++ (e.g., Lambdas, class deduction templates).

This course is **NOT** a Quantum Computing course but intends to show you how to use QC simulation on Meluxina's FPGA.

We strongly recommend to interested particpants this [CERN online course)(https://indico.cern.ch/event/970903/).
