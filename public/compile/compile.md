* We are going to focus on `DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA`.
* Create a symbolic at the root of your home directory pointing to this folder:
```bash
$ cd
$ ln -s oneAPI-samples/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted
$ tree -d -L 2 GettingStarted

```

* The **fpga_compile** folder provides basic examples to start compiling SYCL C++ code with the DPC++ compiler

* The **fpga_recompile** folder show you how to recompile quickly your code without having to rebuild the FPGA image

* The **fpga_template** is a starting template project that you can use to bootstrap a project


## Discovering devices

Before targeting a specific hardware accelerator, you need to ensure that the sycl runtime is able to detect it.
!!! example "Commands"
    ```bash linenums="1"
    # Create permanent tmux session
    tmux new -s fpga_session
    # We need a job allocation on a FPGA node
    salloc -A p200117 -t 48:00:00 -q default -p fpga -N 1
    # In order to use the  intel-compiler-2023.2.1
    module use /project/home/p200117/apps/u100057/easybuild/modules/all
    module load 520nmx/20.4
    # The fpga_compile version setup all necessary environment variable to compile code
    module load intel-compilers/2023.2.1-fpga_compile
    sycl-ls
    ```

!!! success "Output"
    ```bash 
    [opencl:cpu:0] Intel(R) OpenCL, AMD EPYC 7452 32-Core Processor                 3.0 [2022.13.3.0.16_160000]

    ```

* If you see the same output, you are all setup.

## Compilation (manually)
![](./images/compile_time-1.png)

* Recalling that full compilation can take hours depending on your application size.
* In this context, emulation and static report evaluation are keys to succeed in FPGA programming

!!! warning "Full compilation & hardware profiling"
    Don't try a classical debug approach while hoping to solve a problem using multiple design iterations in this condition. 
    HLS-FPGA programming can be very tedious but SYCL simplifies greatly the process.

    ```

* The `vector_add.cpp` source file contains all the necessary to understand how to create a SYCL program

* **lines 4 and 5** are the minimal headers to include in your SYCL program

* **line 9** is a forward declaration of the kernel name

* **lines 11-19** is a function representing our kernel. Note the absence of `__kernel`, `__global` as it exists in OpenCL

* **lines 30-36** are pragmas defining whether you want a full compilation, a CPU emulation or the simulator

* **line 39** is the queue creation. The queue is bounded to a device. We will discuss it later in details.

* **lines 41-46** provides debugging information at runtime.

* **lines 48-54** instantiates 3 vectors. `vec_a` and `vec_b` are input C++ arrays and are initialized inside the next loop. `vec_c` is an output C++ array collecting computation results between `vec_a` and `vec_b`.

* **lines 60-62** create buffers for each vector and specify their size. The runtime copies the data to the FPGA global memory when the kernel starts

* **line 64** submits a command group to the device queue

* **lines 66-68** relies on accessor to infer data dependencies. "read_only" accessor have to wait for data to be fetched. "no_init" option indicates ito the runtime know that the previous contents of the buffer can be discarded

* **lines 70-73** starts a single tasks (single work-item) and call the kernel function

* **lines 99-105** catch SYCL exceptions and terminate the execution

### Emulation

* FPGA emulation refers to the process of using a software or hardware system to mimic the behavior of an FPGA device. This is usually done to test, validate, and debug FPGA designs before deploying them on actual hardware. The Intel® FPGA emulator runs the code on the host cpu.

* Emulation is crucial to validate the functionality of your kernel design. 

* During emulation, your are not seeking for performance.

!!! example "Compile for emulation (in one step)"
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes vector_add.cpp -o vector_add.fpga_emu
    ```

Intel uses the SYCL Ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation which as two steps:

1. The "compile" stage compiles the device code to an intermediate representation (SPIR-V).

2. The "link" stage invokes the compiler's FPGA backend before linking.

!!! example "Two-steps compilation"
    ```bash
    # Compile 
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes -o vector_add.cpp.o -c vector_add.cpp
    # Link
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes vector_add.cpp.o -o vector_add.fpga_emu
    ```

!!! tip "Practical session"
    * Go to the `GettingStarted/fpga_compile/part4_dpcpp_lambda_buffers/src`
    * Apply the previous command (single or two steps). What do you read ?    


* The compiler option `-qactypes` informs the compiler to sreahc and include the Algorithmic C (AC) data type folder for header and libs to the AC data types libraries for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and CPU compilations.
* The [Algorithmic C (AC) datatypes](https://hlslibs.org/) libraries include a numerical set of datatypes and an interface datatype for modeling channels in communicating processes in C++.

### Static reports

* During the process of compiling an FPGA hardware image with the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler, various checkpoints are provided at different compilation steps. These steps include object files generation, an FPGA early image object generation, an FPGA image object generation, and finally executables generation. These checkpoints offer the ability to review errors and make modifications to the source code without needing to do a full compilation every time. 

* When you reach the FPGA early image object checkpoint, you can examine the optimization report generated by the compiler. 

* Upon arriving at the FPGA image object checkpoint, the compiler produces a finished FPGA image.

In order to generate the FPGA early image, you will need to add the following option:

* `-Xshardware`

* `-Xstarget=<target>` or `-Xsboard=<board>`

* `-fsycl-link=early`


!!! example "Compile for FPGA early image"
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes -Xshardware -fsycl-link=early -Xstarget=Stratix10 vector_add.cpp -o vector_add_report.a
    ```

* The `vector_add_report.a` is not what we target in priority. We target the reports directory `vector_add_report.prj` which has been created.

!!! tip "Practical session"
    * Go to the `GettingStarted/fpga_compile/part4_dpcpp_lambda_buffers/src`
    * Apply the previous command to the single compilation command
    
    
* You can evaluate whether the estimated kernel performance data is satisfactory by going to the <project_dir>/reports/ directory and examining one of the following files related to your application:

1. report.html: This file can be viewed using Internet browsers of your choice
2. <design_name>.zip: Utilize the Intel® oneAPI FPGA Reports tool,i.e., `fpga_report`

### Full compilation

This phase produces the actual FPGA bitstream, i.e., a file containing the programming data associated with your FPGA chip. This file requires the target FPGA platform to be generated and executed. For FPGA programming, the Intel® oneAPI toolkit requires the [Intel® Quartus® Prime](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime.html) software to generate this bitstream.

!!! example "Full hardware compilation"
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes -Xshardware -Xstarget=Stratix10 -DFPGA_HARDWARE vector_add.cpp -o vector_add_report.fpga
    ```

* The compilation will take several hours. Therefore, we strongly advise you to verify your code through emulation first.

* You can also use the `-Xsfast-compile` option which offers a faster compile time but reduce the performance of the final FPGA image.

### Fast recompilation

* At first glance having a single source file is not necessarily a good idea when host and device compilation differs so much

* However, there is two different strategies to deal with it:

  1. Use a single source file and add the `-reuse-exe`

  2. Separate host and device code compilation in your FPGA project


* This is up to you to choose the method that suits you the most

!!! example "Using the `-reuse-exe` option"
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -qactypes -Xshardware -Xstarget=Stratix10 -DFPGA_HARDWARE -reuse-exe=vector_add.fpga vector_add.cpp -o vector_add.fpga
    ```
    If only the host code changed since the previous compilation, providing the `-reuse-exe=image` flag to `icpx` instructs the compiler to extract the compiled FPGA binary from the existing executable and package it into the new executable, saving the device compilation time.
  
!!! tig "Question"
    * What happens if the vector_add.fpga is missing ?

!!! example "Separating host and device code"
    Go to the `GettingStarted/fpga_recompile` folder. It provides an example of separate host and device code
    The process is similar as the compilation process for OpenCL except that a single tool is used, i.e., `icpx`

    1. Compile the host code:
    ```bash 
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -DFPGA_HARDWARE host.cpp -c -o host.o
    ```
    2. Compile the FPGA image:
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga -Xshardware -Xstarget=Stratix10 -fsycl-link=image kernel.cpp -o dev_image.a
    ```
    3. Link both:
    ```bash
    $ icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga host.o dev_image.a -o fast_recompile.fpga
    ```
